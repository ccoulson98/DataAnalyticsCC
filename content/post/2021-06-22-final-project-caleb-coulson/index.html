<h3>Before using this data I went through it’s quality. On the website I obtained it from it was rated a 7.1/10, so the data quality was not perfect. The first Thing I noticed was that the “Date” columnn was not usable in it’s currect state, so i converted the original data to be in the appropriate “yyyy-mm-dd” format. However a lot of the older data was in an unusable format. Due to the unknow exact dates of these old attacks they were inputted either in an odd format or with the words “reported on” included. This made this data unusable. For this reason I decided 85 years of data was enough so my final data frame used is from the year 1930-2016</h3>

<h3>As expected, the most common activities being performed that lead to a shark attack are swimming and surfing.

<h4>During this data analysis I had a ot of fun. Growing up I always watched shark week so this dataset really caught my eye. I was interested to see that only 20% of shark attacks lead to fatalities. Another Interesting insight was that the countr of “Reunion” had the 9th most shark attacks. i had never heard of this place before so I loked it up and learned it was a french colony. IE, it is part of france but is an island of the south, east coast of Africa. Overall this dataset was pretty easy to work with, with the exception of the dates which required a lot of working with t=in order to be able to use the data set.</h4>
