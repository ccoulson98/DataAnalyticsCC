<h3>Column names were difficult to use so I decided to fix this, in addition to this, some of the data was inputted into the dataframe as value/value, with both the male and female statistics being stored in the same column, deliniated with a “/”, to rectify this I have adjusted the columns that are important to this data analyis in excel by deliniating these values into two sepertae columns. In addition to this, instead of NA being inputted where data was missing, the value “-99” was used a lot so I changed this to display “NA” in these cases.</h3>

<h2>urbanization is characterized by the influx of people moving from rural areas to urban areas such as cities and towns. This was seen in the ameriacas and western europe after the industrial revolution. Many countries are just reaching this point of mass movement towards cities, and some have no reached it atall. This can have large effects on the GDP, and other aspects of a country, we will explore soe of these now. To explore this, i will use the urban population % as the indicator of urbanization First I will compare the GDP of the countries by their urban population %</h2>

<h3>While GDP is a good indicator or a countries wealth, GDP per capita indicates the wealth of “each person” in the country. A Truely healthy country will have a high GDP and a high GDP per capita. For that reason this has been displayed in the same manner as the GDP below.</h3>

<h3>while it can be seen that the data set is small as it is 20 or so points, it can be seen that there is a General trend upwards in GDP as the mean CO2 output per capita increases.

<h4>When I performed this data analysis I ran into some issues with the data that needed rectifying. Firstly the titles of the captions were construted in a manner that were difficult to use so i altered these. The next issue i ran into was there were many inputs in the data frame that were not available for some countries and there were inputted as “-99” instead of “na” meaning i had to convert there inputs to na in order to exclude these values from my analysis as this would skew the results. Another issue i ran into was that when the creator made this dataframe they inputted the male and female data in the same column. I had to go into excel to seperate these columns, however this was an easy fix. The other issue i ran into while performing this data analysis was when i kept having the lables overlap, and i had to watch some videos online in order to discover how to rectify this. Overall I’m very pleases with how this data analysis turned out. i encountered some problems attempting to do the analysis I wanted to do but I overcame them for the most part.</h4>
