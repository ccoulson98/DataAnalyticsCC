## This post contains two data visualizations, and are as follows

* one Numerical visualization
* one Categorical data visualization

## The following data was used to create the data visualizations that follow


```{r message= FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
mtcars 
```

## The first Data visualization concerns ata was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine and relates the weight of vehicles to the miles per gallon

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y= mpg),colour(cyl)) +
  geom_point() + labs(title = "Miles per Gallon vs. weight of vehicles from 1974", x = "weight(1000lb)", y = "Miles per Gallon")
```

## The second data visualization is categorical and defines the number of cylinders in the engines of the vehicles of 1974

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cyl,)) +
  geom_bar()+ labs(title = "Number of cyclinders in engines of cars from 1974", x = "Number of Cylinders", y = "Count")
```
