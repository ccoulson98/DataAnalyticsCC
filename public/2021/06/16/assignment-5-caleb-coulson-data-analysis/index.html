<h2>urbanization is characterized by the influx of people moving from rural areas to urban areas such as cities and towns. This was seen in the ameriacas and western europe after the industrial revolution. Many countries are just reaching this point of mass movement towards cities, and some have no reached it atall. This can have large effects on the GDP, and other aspects of a country, we will explore soe of these now. To explore this, i will use the urban population % as the indicator of urbanization First I will compare the GDP of the countries by their urban population %</h2>

<h4>When I performed this data analysis I ran into some issues with the data that needed rectifying. Firstly the titles of the captions were construted in a manner that were difficult to use so i altered these. The next issue i ran into was there were many inputs in the data frame that were not available for some countries and there were inputted as “-99” instead of “na” meaning i had to convert there inputs to na in order to exclude these values from my analysis as this would skew the results. Another issue i ran into was that when the creator made this dataframe they inputted the male and female data in the same column. I had to go into excel to seperate these columns, however this was an easy fix. The other issue i ran into while performing this data analysis was when i kept having the lables overlap, and i had to watch some videos online in order to discover how to rectify this. Overall I’m very pleases with how this data analysis turned out. i encountered some problems attempting to do the analysis I wanted to do but I overcame them for the most part.</h4>
